What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that was being solved throughout this course was learning how different data structures can store data. In the final project we were tasked with sorting a printing courses at the users request.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures are important to understand because as we learend different data structures are better for sorting and storing different types of information. I approached this problem by finding out the best way to store this data efficently and in an organized manner. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When going through these projects and activities I had run into numerous roadblocks. I found some of these to be very frusterating and discouraging. I overcame these with much support. Some of those include emailing back and forth with professor Griffith. I also spent many hours in the 24/7 tutoring that was offered by snhu. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I  would say my work on this project has expanded my approach to developing programs in the future by teaching me new stratagies or order to organize differnt types of data.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
After alot of time and tutoring I would say by the end of this course I was able to use data strucutres in order to write code that was maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
